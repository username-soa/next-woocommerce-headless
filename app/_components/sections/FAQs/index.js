      question: "How long will it take for my order to get to me?",
      answer: `<p>
      We pride ourselves on our fast turn around times! All our
      orders ship within 1-3 business days. If you chose free
      shipping, your order will be sent via USPS standard shipping,
      which usually takes around 2-5 days domestically and 1-2 weeks
      internationally. This is an estimate, as USPS often becomes busy
      around holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need your order sooner, please feel welcome to choose one
      of our upgraded shipping options at checkout.
